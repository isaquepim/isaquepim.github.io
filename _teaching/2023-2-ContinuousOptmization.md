Here's a link to professor's [Vincent](https://www.vincentgyg.com/teaching) personal website. There you can find lecture notes and exercise sheets.

Here's some reference that you can find online for free [Boyd and Vandenberghe](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) (I personally studied from this book when I took the course). If you find useful to watch recorded lectures, Stanford has some available online from their [Convex Optimization I (EE 364A)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3940DD956CDF0622) course.
