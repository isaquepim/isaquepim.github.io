Hi! I'm a master's student at the School of Applied Mathematics, Getulio Vargas Foudation (FGV - EMAp). I hold a BSc in Applied Mathematics from FGV-EMAp.


My main interests are High-Dimensional Statistics and Bayesian Variable Selection. I'm under the supervision of [Luiz Max Carvalho](https://github.com/maxbiostat). 


I'm currently working with spatial models to analyze a rich set of epidemiological data from the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The goal is to distangle the main driving factors for the epidemic.

I'm also putting considerable effort into statistical phenomena in high dimension, and how to better exploit it for variable selection. Publication info soon...
