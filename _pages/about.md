Hi! I'm a master's student at the School of Applied Mathematics, Getulio Vargas Foudation (FGV - EMAp). I hold a BSc in Applied Mathematics from FGV-EMAp.

My main interests are High-Dimensional Statistics and Bayesian Variable Selection. I'm under the advisement of [Luiz Max Carvalho](https://github.com/maxbiostat).
