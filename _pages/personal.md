In elementary and high school, I loved mathematics. Due to a good record on the Brazilian Mathematical Olympiads of Public Schools [OBMEP](https://www.obmep.org.br/) I was invited to be part of [CDMC](https://cdmc.fgv.br/), a project that recruits and finances young talents to study mathematics in higher education.
