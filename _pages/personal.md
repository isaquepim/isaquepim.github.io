# About me 

In elementary and high school, I loved mathematics. Thanks to my good record in the Brazilian Mathematical Olympiads of Public Schools [(OBMEP)](https://www.obmep.org.br/), I was invited to join [CDMC](https://cdmc.fgv.br/), a project that identifies and supports young talents in pursuing higher education in mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I became captivated by Probability, which resonated with my worldview. Today, data-driven decision-making has become the norm in companies, governments, and even in everyday life due to the perceived objectivity of data. 'People lie, but numbers don't,' they say. [Were it so easy...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubKUMlEppAs&ab_channel=JimmyButtWhiff)

[Statistics is hard](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/03/05/statistics-is-hard-etc-again/), data analysis hides many traps, but it is too important to be left to statisticians*! 

My goal is to develop high-quality tools and methods for statistical analysis, making robust methods readily available to anyone, and contributing to better interpretation and accessibility of statistical techniques.
